# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview

This application allows users to browse and filter country data. It utilizes React, Redux, and custom hooks for state management and asynchronous data fetching.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm or yarn package manager

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   or, if you're using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.This project uses [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) for testing hooks and components. Run this command to execute all tests and get detailed output.

For example:

```bash
npm test
```

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.Your app is ready for deployment.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run lint`

Checks for linting errors using ESLint. Make sure to resolve any issues reported to ensure code quality.

```bash
npm run lint
```

### `npm run lint:fix`

Automatically fixes linting issues, where possible.

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

It will copy all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project directory, giving you full control.

## Features

- **Filter and Sort Countries**: Filter countries by name, continent, or sort them by temperature and name in ascending or descending order.
- **View Weather Data**: Fetch and display real-time weather information for country capitals.
- **Pagination**: Navigate through large lists of countries with a paginated view.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures usability on mobile and desktop devices.

## Application Structure

- **Components**: Contains reusable UI components like `CountryList`, `SearchBar`, and `FilterDropdown`.
- **Hooks**: Contains custom hooks like `useEnrichedCountries` and `useFilteredCountries` for managing state and logic.
- **Redux**: Manages global state for countries and error handling.
- **Tests**: Includes unit tests for hooks and components to ensure reliability.

### Deployment

To deploy the app, follow these steps:

1. Build the app for production:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Deploy the `build` folder to a web server of your choice. Popular options include:

   - [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
   - [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
   - [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
   - [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

---

### Troubleshooting

- If you encounter dependency conflicts, try running:

  ```bash
  npm install --legacy-peer-deps
  ```

- For issues related to CORS when fetching APIs, consider using a proxy or deploying the app on a domain that bypasses CORS restrictions.

---

### Future Improvements

- Add more detailed country information such as languages and demographics.
- Implement user authentication for personalized experiences.
- Introduce caching for frequently accessed weather data to optimize performance.

## Written Explanations

### Architecture and Design

The application follows a modular and component-based architecture using React, with key features such as:

- **Component Reusability**: Components like `CountryCard`, `WeatherInfo`, and `SearchBar` are designed to be reusable across different parts of the application.
- **Custom Hooks**: Hooks like `useEnrichedCountries` and `useFilteredCountries` encapsulate reusable business logic, keeping components clean and focused on UI concerns.
- **State Management**: Redux is integrated for global state management, enabling predictable state updates and improving maintainability.
- **Performance Optimization**: Features like lazy loading, code splitting, and pagination ensure efficient rendering and a seamless user experience.

**Benefits**:

- **Scalability**: The architecture supports adding new features with minimal impact on existing code.
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes it easier to debug and extend.
- **Stakeholder Value**: Improves the development experience for engineers and ensures high performance and reliability for end-users.

### Challenges Faced

- **CORS Restrictions**: Several third-party APIs imposed CORS restrictions. To address this, proxying or middleware solutions were implemented, and API alternatives were explored.
- **Data Inconsistencies**: Handling variations in API responses required robust validation and fallback mechanisms to ensure application stability.
- **Testing Complexities**: Writing unit tests for hooks and asynchronous data-fetching logic demanded a careful setup of mock data and dependencies.

### Reflections and Next Steps

- **Regrets**:
  - Some advanced optimizations, like server-side rendering (SSR), were not implemented due to time constraints.
  - More comprehensive integration testing could have been added to ensure end-to-end reliability.

- **Next Steps**:
  - Implement SSR for improved SEO and faster initial page loads.
  - Add detailed analytics and logging to monitor user behavior and application performance.
  - Explore micro-frontend architecture for future scalability in larger applications.
  - Improve TypeScrip and ESLint configurations
